# VESNOS #

VEhicular Secure Network Open Simulator (VESNOS) is an open-source integrated VANET C++ simulator, an updated version of VENTOS, that extends the SUMO TraCI API by providing new methods. VESNOS provides a more realistic connected vehicle environment and supports different vehicle dynamics and driving behaviors, including conventional vehicles and CVs, using the US-DOT message security solution for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based approach that employs highly innovative methods of encryption and certificate management to facilitate trusted communication.
